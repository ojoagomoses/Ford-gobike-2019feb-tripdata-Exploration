## Dataset

Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.

Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.

This data set includes information about individual rides made in Ford GoBike bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area


## Summary of Findings
- A large percentage of the riders are male(74%). thrice as much as the female(23%).
- over 90% of riders in our dataset are subscriber. that means they pay subscription fee which could be monthly or year. only a small percentage of the riders are customers. that means they pay at the station or Kiosk per every trip.
- Female go on longer trips (567 seconds or aproximately 10mins). though the difference is much from the trip duration for males.
- Customers go on a longer trip (780 sec or 13mins) than Subscribers(490 secs or 9mins).
- Riders went on longer trips on Weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)
- There is no linear relationship between age and duration of a trip. However most people who took longer trips were between the age of 25 and 45
