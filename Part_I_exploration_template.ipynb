    "\n",
    "Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.\n",

    "This data set includes information about individual rides made in Ford GoBike bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area\n",
